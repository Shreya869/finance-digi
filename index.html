                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">By far the most important financial concept, describes how important the value of time is in building wealth.  Money invested today is worth
                    more than money invested at any point in the future. That's because it has more time to grow and compound.</p>

                    After all, people fear what they don't understand and most beginners don't really understand the stock market.</p>

                <h2 class="text-lg text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">Interest Rate</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">You must understand how interest rates and overall rate of returns affect almost everything in your financial life.  For example, investing your money at 7% versus 5%, over 40 years, means that you will have twice as much money, that's right, twice as much money, for retirement.  This is also the precise reason that it is so important to lower your investment fees.

                <h2 class="text-lg text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">Opportunity Costs</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base"> Understand that wherever you spend your time and money is a cost that you cannot spend elsewhere.  The money spent on a car could be invested in the stock market.  The car will decline in value while the investments will thrive.  Make each decision while paying attention to other ways that you could spend or invest that money.
                      Choose the opportunity that maximizes your long term wealth</p>

                <h2 class="text-lg text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">Diversify your Risk and Investments</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Another important concept to keep your finances balanced. Don't keep all of your money in just a few assets like your house or your company stock.  Make sure that you spread your investments over many different asset classes.  Also, make sure that if you hold a lot of mutual funds,
                     that they do not overlap, or you may not be diversified as you think.</p>

                <h2 class="text-lg text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">The Compounding effect of Money</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Maybe the second most important basic financial concept to understand.  Understanding this is key to being able to forecast future growth.  Your money may grow at the same rate each year in terms of percent, but in terms of actual dollar growth, compounding means that your money will grow faster and faster each year as a result of earning money not just on your investment,
                     but also on the returns from that investment.</p>

              <p class="text-base leading-relaxed xl:w-2/4 lg:w-3/4 mx-auto">Speaking of Financial Services in particular, 
                we know that it is a relationship building business. 
                 As stated by Don Connelly on many occasions, before someone will do business with you there are three
                  things that must take place in the relationship: <br>“That person must like you, trust you and think you are smart.”

                 <br>
                 <br>Effective storytelling is a great tool by which Financial Advisors can instantly establish a
                  personal connection with their prospects</p>

              <br class="hidden lg:inline-block">
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Years ago, a hockey game between the Boston Bruins and Edmonton Oilers had been paused for some technical issues with the stadium lights. To kill some time, the announcers started interviewing people including the Edmonton Oilers, Wayne Gretzky, undoubtedly the world’s greatest hockey player at the time. The announcer stated that Gretzky wasn’t the biggest guy in the league, or the strongest, or the fastest or the toughest, yet he was regarded as the greatest hockey player in the world.  So, how then did Gretzky explain his own genius?  Gretzky simply replied:

                “I don’t go where the puck is; I go where the puck is going to be!”
                
                <br>
                <br>
                In a simple one liner, Gretzky confirmed that his success did not come from chasing the puck. 
                Instead it came from staying one step ahead and by anticipating  where the puck would  likely go next.
                
                Use this powerful story to explain to your clients why it is important to look at the future potential of an investment instead of focusing on past performance.</p>

          </h1>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">“Terry’s boss decides to send him out on a practical field trip on his first day. He throws him right into the deep end by asking him to visit an interested prospect at the posh end of town… where the big money is in Windows/Double-glazing sales. So off he goes.

            He was extremely nervous. With his hands shaking and his knees knobbing, he approaches the front door and thuds the door knocker several times. An old woman approaches and, after his first shaking introduction, she invites him in.
            
            He stays there for over 3 hours. Then, after dozens of cups of tea and mounds of biscuits, the woman signs a contract and purchases over £7000 worth of windows (that’s over $11,000 in U.S. dollars!)
            
            And, here’s The REAL Kicker – The woman had already spoken with 6 other dynamite glazing salesmen that week. ALL of them offered her a cheaper quote! That’s right – Terry’s price was the MOST expensive. He was also the most inexperienced salesman..”
            
            So, what happened in the background? And moreover, how can you replicate these powerful sales techniques to step up a notch on your own profit ladder? Here comes the secret.
            
            The woman said, “She LIKED the young lad more than the others.”

    Use this story at one of your sales meetings to explain how politeness and likeability can become deal makers.</p>

            <br class="hidden lg:inline-block">and The Elephant
          </h1>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">“Once, 6 blind men are asked to describe an elephant. The first one touches the side and describes the elephant like a wall. The second one touches the tusk and calls it a spear. The third one touches the trunk and describes it as a snake. The forth one touches the knee and calls it a tree. The fifth one touches the ear and says it’s a fan. 
              Finally the last one touches the tail and describes the Elephant as a Rope!“
        
        <br>
    <br>
    Because their perceptions lead to the misinterpretation. They all describe the elephant differently, just on the basis of the part of the elephant they touched.

Let’s see how this relates to stock markets and investors.
Consider the stock market as the elephant while investors or participants in the stock market as the blind men.

When you are driving alone and you see a speed trap – you slow down. However after you’ve passed it, you continue to drive slowly because you think there is another one out there. Similarly, people panic when their portfolio goes down and they think it will continue to do so. They feel excited when their portfolio goes up and they think it will continue to go up. What they forget is that their goal is long term.  Markets go up and down every day! The current performance of the market does not alter their goal to retire comfortably 
20 years down the line.</p>
